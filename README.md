# odin-landing-page

A simple landing page with some dummy text.

This is an exercise for [the Flexbox section](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#flexbox) of The Odin Project. The webpage has four main sections and a footer, including elements such as headings, lists, links, buttons, images, and text, aligned using Flexbox. 

Full guidelines of this project can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page).
